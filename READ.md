# Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation Menu

## Overview
This project is part of my Web Development Internship with Prodigy. The goal was to create a responsive landing page featuring an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu has a fixed position and is visible on all pages. It changes color or style on scroll and hover for better user experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the content.
- CSS: For styling the navigation menu and the rest of the page.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity to the navigation menu.
